# ESG Stock Analysis
This project explores the relationship between Environmental,social,and Governance(ESG) scores and stock performance of companies in the industrial sector.

## Objective.
To analyze how ESG factors from various rating providers (SNP, Sustainalytics, MSCI) relate to 1-year stock price change percentages.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## 📁 Dataset Overview
- 705 companies
- 31 columns including ESG scores, financial metrics, and company details
- Handled missing values and calculated ESG average scores

## 📈 Key Analysis
- Distribution of ESG scores
- Correlation between ESG score and stock performance
- Sector-wise ESG score comparison
- Optional regression analysis (Linear Regression)

## 🧠 Outcome
- Weak correlation (~0.03) between ESG scores and 1-year stock return
- Regression model shows poor predictive power (R² ≈ -0.10)
- Insights suggest ESG alone doesn't determine short-term performance
